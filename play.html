    <p class="stage-direction">Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">Before God, I am exceeding weary.</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
        have attached one of so high blood.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
        complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
        it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>
    <p class="speech">Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as
        to remember so weak a composition.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,
        by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
        small beer. <br>But, indeed, these humble
        considerations make me out of love with my
        greatness.<br> What a disgrace is it to me to remember
        thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
        take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
        hast, viz.<br> these, and those that were thy
        peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
        shirts, as, one for superfluity,<br> and another for
        use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
        than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
        thou keepest not racket there;<br> as thou hast not done
        a great while, because the rest of thy low
        countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
        and God knows,<br> whether those that bawl out the ruins
        of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
        midwives say the children<br> are not in the fault;
        whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
        mightily strengthened.</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>
    <p class="speech">How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
        you should talk so idly! Tell me,<br> how many good
        young princes would do so,<br> their fathers being so
        sick as yours at this time is?</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
        will tell.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be
        sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
        thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
        better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
        indeed too.</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">Very hardly upon such a subject.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
        book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
        persistency:<br> let the end try the man. But I tell
        thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so<br>
        sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
        hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">The reason?</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">It would be every man's thought; and thou art a
        blessed fellow to think as every man thinks:<br> never
        a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way
        better than thine:<br> every man would think me an
        hypocrite indeed.<br> And what accites your most
        worshipful thought to think so?</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
        engraffed to Falstaff.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRINCE-HENRY">PRINCE HENRY</h6>

    <p class="speech">And to thee.</p>

    <h6 class="name POINS">POINS</h6>

    <p class="speech">By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it
        with my own ears:<br> the worst that they can say of
        me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
        proper fellow of my hands;<br> and those two things, I
        confess, I cannot help.<br> By the mass, here comes Bardolph.</p>
