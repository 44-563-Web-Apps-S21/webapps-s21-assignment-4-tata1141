            <h5>SCENE II. London. Another street.<br>
Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS</h5>
<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
Before God, I am exceeding weary.<br>
POINS<br>
Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
have attached one of so high blood.<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?<br>
POINS<br>
Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as
to remember so weak a composition.<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,
by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
small beer. <br>But, indeed, these humble
considerations make me out of love with my
greatness.<br> What a disgrace is it to me to remember
thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
hast, viz.<br> these, and those that were thy
peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
shirts, as, one for superfluity,<br> and another for
use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
thou keepest not racket there;<br> as thou hast not done
a great while, because the rest of thy low
countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
and God knows,<br> whether those that bawl out the ruins
of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
midwives say the children<br> are not in the fault;
whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
mightily strengthened.<br>
POINS<br>
How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
you should talk so idly! Tell me,<br> how many good
young princes would do so,<br> their fathers being so
sick as yours at this time is?<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?<br>
POINS<br>
Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.<br>
POINS<br>
Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
will tell.<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be
sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
indeed too.<br>
POINS<br>
Very hardly upon such a subject.<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
persistency:<br> let the end try the man. But I tell
thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so<br>
sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.<br>
POINS<br>
The reason?<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?<br>
POINS<br>
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
It would be every man's thought; and thou art a
blessed fellow to think as every man thinks:<br> never
a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way
better than thine:<br> every man would think me an
hypocrite indeed.<br> And what accites your most
worshipful thought to think so?<br>
POINS<br>
Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
engraffed to Falstaff.<br>
PRINCE HENRY<br>
And to thee.<br>
POINS<br>
By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it
with my own ears:<br> the worst that they can say of
me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
proper fellow of my hands;<br> and those two things, I
confess, I cannot help.<br> By the mass, here comes Bardolph.
